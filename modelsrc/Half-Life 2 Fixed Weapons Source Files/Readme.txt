These are the source files used to make small edits to these weapons.

If you don't know how to use these files, refer to the Gamebanana link that you downloaded from and look at the images.

I personally use Crowbar to decompile these files to use:
https://steamcommunity.com/groups/CrowbarTool
But you can use any .mdl compiler like StudioMDL

The .mdl and other file contents compiled are placed in:
models\weapons (These files are placed into the "weapons" folder)

Weapon textures are placed in:
materials\models\items (The texture is placed in the "items" folder)

Weapon sounds are placed in:
sound\weapons\*weapon name folder* (The *weapon name folder* stands for a weapon like "pistol")

The .qc and reference smds were edited for most weapons while holster.smd was added in the anims folder.

Have at it.
